# Mission to Mars:

I built a web application that will scrape various websites for data and images pertaining to the Mission to Mars. We compile all of this information into a single HTML page. In order to achieve this, I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mar's hemispheres. We then used Mongo database to store the scraped data and then use a web application to display the data. In order to accommodate for mobile view (i.e. tablet/cell phones), we had to make adjustments to the images. 

I am attaching the following images showing Mar's hemispheres that were captured in our project.
